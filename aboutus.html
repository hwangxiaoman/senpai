      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Much of history is ruled by reaction. The Bretton Woods conference was held in response to the world’s economic uncertainty following World War II, the League of Nations was founded as a response to the events of World War I, the 2008 financial crisis occurred (partly) in reaction to insecure lending practices by banks, the rise of communism as a common ideology was spurred by imbalanced power structures that were reinforced following the industrial revolution. To list all the reactionary events in human history would be to list much of history itself.<br><br>

      Much of history is ruled by reaction. The Bretton Woods conference was held in response to the world’s economic uncertainty following World War II, the League of Nations was founded as a response to the events of World War I, the 2008 financial crisis occurred (partly) in reaction to insecure lending practices by banks, the rise of communism as a common ideology was spurred by imbalanced power structures that were reinforced following the industrial revolution. To list all the reactionary events in human history would be to list much of history itself.<br><br>

      History has shown us that what came before often shapes what is to come. Therefore, how can we extrapolate reactionary phases of the past to think about our future? In understanding the history of one field, can this help us hypothesize the future of another? More to the point, what can the history of architecture teach us about the future of web design?<br><br>

      There are a few similarities between architecture and web design that make them a natural fit for comparison. First — technology and technological advancements are incredibly important in both fields. Innovations such as reinforced concrete, elevators, and structural steel allowed for the first skyscrapers to be built. Similarly, responsive coding, mobile devices, content management systems, and advancements in APIs and libraries allow us to build digital experiences that would have been impossible during the early days of the web. Second, both web design and architecture are both strongly influenced by the economic circumstances surrounding them as they serve as not only tools of expression, but also as commerce. The balance between art and commerce also plays a role within both fields: when constructing a warehouse, aesthetic beauty is often not a priority; when building a one-page web toy, monetization is often not a priority. Finally, both fields share a common language. Transparency, depth, light and shadows, colours, materials, scale, shape, and structure are of paramount importance in both. Considerations of interaction, feedback, and accessibility are indelible to the two fields. They share a commonality of being designed objects for people to use.<br><br>

      The history of architecture and web design have been shaped by reacting to and absorbing the world around them. The context surrounding periods of growth and change is hugely important to understanding the way that both fields have evolved. For architecture, the economic, technologic, and social changes the early 20th century in addition to the existence of dominant and well-established styles of architecture proved to be the ground on which the Modernist style developed. In web design the expanding presence of the internet, the growth of digital literacy among users, advances in technology (particularly the advent of smartphones) and (once again) the existence of a dominant style among digital products led to the advent of the style of flat design. The tradition of self-reflexivity that we’ve seen in a myriad of fields (painting, sculpture, film, to name a few) was continued in how architecture and web design continued to evolve, exemplified by the architectural movement of Postmodernism and the styles of Flat 2.0 and brutalism. Postmodernism architecture and brutalist web design in particular embodied reacting to the world that surrounded them as they concerned themselves with growing corporatization, individuality, and challenging established societal norms.<br><br>

      Going forward, the fields of architecture and web design will continue to use the contexts that surround them to inform their formal characteristics. In order to creatively solve the issues that the world puts forth these fields will of course have to look outwards — towards at the world itself. However, looking inwards at the history of their fields can help architects and web designers understand how far they have come, what they still have yet to learn, the patterns of their fields, and how architects and web designers of the past solved the problems that faced them. In understanding how we responded to the past, maybe we can understand how to respond to the present, and how we can respond to our impending future.
